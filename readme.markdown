### Credit

Buildall was created by me, Christopher Pilkington.   
For the parts that are not mine, I try to keep an up to date list of any third party libraries that I use.   
I only use libraries that are license under either the GPL, LGPL or similar and am eternally grateful for the high quality, ease of use and generosity of the open source community.
